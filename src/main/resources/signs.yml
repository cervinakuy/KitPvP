# SIGNS FILE - Customize the formatting of the signs, and also the storage for the locations of the signs.
#
# Recommendations:
# 1) When creating kit signs, make sure the kit name is typed EXACTLY the same as shown in the kits.yml. The casing must match or else it won't find it.
# 2) If you make an error while making a kit sign, remove or modify the Sign data stored at the bottom of this file.
#
# Please contact Cervinakuy (the developer) on Spigot if you have any problems.
