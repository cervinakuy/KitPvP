# KILLSTREAKS FILE - Add in custom rewards or modify what events occur when a player reaches a certain streak.
#
# Recommendations:
# 1) The number at the beginning of each streak is the streak number.
# 2) Any commands in this entire plugin support PlaceholderAPI placeholders.
# 3) You can change whether a streak is enabled at the bottom of each streak, "Streak-Enabled: "
# 4) When adding your own streak, please remember to indent using ONLY spaces. It is recommended that you simply copy and modify a streak that already exists.
#
# Please contact Cervinakuy (the developer) on Spigot if you have any problems.
